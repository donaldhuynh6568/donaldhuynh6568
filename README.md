### Background

I graduated from UC Santa Barbara with a Bachelor of Science in Biology. After getting opportunities to leverage coding and statistics to analyze biological experiments, I knew I wanted to pursue a career in data science. I started to spend my time leveraging coding and statistics to create content analysis projects that can provide insights for consumers. As a current data analyst, I typically take the initiative to look for opportunities to automate tasks for my team as well as leverage our data to add value for operations management.
