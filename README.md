### Background 

With a Bachelor of Science in Biology from UC Santa Barbara, I have always had a passion for data analysis and utilizing scientific methodologies to drive results. My education in biology provided a strong foundation for my analytical mindset, and I quickly realized that data science was the field where I could apply my skills and drive meaningful impact.

Since graduation, I have honed my technical skills in coding and statistics to create data-driven projects that provide valuable insights to stakeholders. As a current Data Analyst, I take the initiative to find opportunities to streamline tasks and leverage data to drive improvements in business operations. My ability to work closely with leadership and my commitment to delivering high-quality work has allowed me to consistently add value to my team and company. I am eager to continue growing as a data professional and look forward to new opportunities to utilize my skills and drive impact.
